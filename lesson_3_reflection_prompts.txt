When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When I want to share it with other people of course!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Probably someone else has edited the commits online, and we don't want
these changes on our end.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks are on github only; clones could be from github to local, or local only; both of them will be two repositories. Branches only contain one repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

In case other people would update the remote without prior notice, you
can compare your local copy and the remote to find out where and how
the changes happened.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

Set up a file server and let collabrators have access to it, and they
can update the files there. Of course Github will be easier to use!

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
